\section{Introduction}

Most video games on the market today are geared towards players with fast reflexes and favor quick action over careful planning. This trend has particularly affected the Console Role Playing Game.  Where in the past the pace of the game afforded time to choose an action and select it, newer games progress at a breakneck pace, leading to less direct player interaction and more scripted actions.  One such game, Final Fantasy XII, allowed the player to provide sets of actions for their characters to perform automatically in battle in addition to manually entered actions. \cite{Gambits} This preserved a significant amount of tactical planning in the game. A well-designed set of actions could often make the difference between victory and defeat.

A game that only allowed battle actions through pre-defined character tactics would force the player to think deeply about their opponents and characters in order to develop a winning strategy. 

\section{Previous Work/Related Work}

There are several other games that feature similar gameplay mechanics.  

\begin{description}
\item[RoboCode \cite{RoboCode}] \hfill \\
      ``Robocode is a programming game, where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or .NET.'' Robocode contains a similar ``AI'' approach to player interaction, but requires the user to create their AI in a supported programming language.  This limits the potential audience to programmers and those willing to learn.  Ideally non-programmers would be able to play the game as well.

\item[Final Fantasy XII \cite{Gambits}] \hfill \\
      Final Fantasy XII is the primarily influence for AutoRPG. Final Fantasy XII allows for the player to override the pre-programmed strategies at any time.  This allows a sufficiently fast player to react to battle events as they occur rather than predicting them ahead of time.  Ideally players would not be rewarded to quick reflexes but for thinking ahead and planning out their strategy in advance.

%What other solutions have been proposed or implemented for this problem? Why are they not good enough? You must prepare the readers to believe that your solution (which you have not yet said anything about) is better than these other attempts. This is also the section where you describe any work that your solution is built on top of. Include references to relevant related work.

\section{Implementation}

A simple prototype game was developed in Python using the PyGame game development framework.  The game supported a simple frontend to visualize the more interesting backend action. The game features a battle system that completely disallows user interaction, instead forcing the user to develop pre-defined strategies ahead of time.

\subsection{Frontend}

The frontend largely serves to display the information for the battle.  It serves a secondary purpose of allowing future development to occur on the 

\subsection{Battle Backend}

The battle backend serves primarily as a stimuli-response system.  Characters take turns deciding a course of action and performing that action.  All possible actions are predefined as Python Classes.  Actions include a simple Attack or Spells.  Armor can be used to reduce damage from weapons, and elemental attributes can be used to reduce or increase the potential damage.  

Conditions are somewhat more flexible.  In theory, any attribute of a player or enemy can be examined to determine whether an action should be taken.  These can be as simple as choosing the enemy with the least hit points remaining to complicated queries designed to strike the enemy most likely to cause the most damage.

%(b) Main Algorithm or Interesting Details. Either describe the main algorithm in your project or if appropriate, Pick some of the key areas of your project that you are particularly proud of (that were either complex or tricky or just the most interesting to you). Describe in detail your solution to these aspects of your overall problem. Think about someone else trying to implement what you just did, what information would be most useful for them?

\section{Results} 
%Describe your results. Please include at least 3-6 screen shots of your results, which highlight the capabilities of your project.

\section{Future Work}

Future endeavors should probably be directed towards modifying existing games, rather than continuing work on a from-scratch game.  Most RPG type games probably feature a very structured set of actions and character interactions.  Adding on a structured stimuli-response system similar to what has been prototyped here would be a relatively simple task.

Once the backend has been put in place, competitions could be formed around the system, such as those often associated with RoboCode.  Player vs Player would be tricky to set up.  Player vs. Computer situations would be much easier to establish and regulate.  Categories such as least moves to win against pregenerated opponents would have people optimizing their strategies well. 

If the prototype implementation were to be improved in some manner, the best way forward would be to make the combat more complex so that more complex strategies could be built around it.  Ideas for expansion would involve multiple characters on the player team, the ability to target multiple combatants with abilities, and strategies that can choose targets based on these additions. More complex equipment loadouts and damage potential could also lead to to more complex strategy possibilities.
