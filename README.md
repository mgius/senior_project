# Dependencies
## PyGame
This project depends on PyGame 1.9.1.  As of 2010-12-27, Debian does
not contain a new enough version of PyGame (although Ubuntu does).
You will need to install a new version of PyGame to run this program.

If you have easy_install installed, installing the latest pygame is as
simple as running

    easy_install -U pygame

You may need to add yourself to appropriate groups in order to run
this command as a mortal user.
